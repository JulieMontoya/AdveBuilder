# AdveBuilder

Create text adventure games for the BBC Micro, from an SQLite3 database using
host-side tools and a 6502 cross assembler such as BeebAsm.

# birthday_adv

Birthday Adventure is a simple game created using the AdveBuilder engine,
more as a proof of concept than a serious game  (although it is actually
quite playable).  Note that this repository necessarily contains spoilers!
It's hard to talk about how a game was made, without giving away information
that would spoil the fun.  So here is a link straight to the disc image
[birthday_adv.ssd](https://github.com/JulieMontoya/AdveBuilder/blob/main/birthday_adv/birthday_adv.ssd)
so you can play it now and solve it on your own without seeing anything you
don't want to.

# src

BeebAsm source code for the AdveBuilder game engine.

# scripts

Perl and shell scripts for working with the SQLite3 database on the host.
