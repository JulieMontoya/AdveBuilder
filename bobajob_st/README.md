Bobajob Street

Bobajob Street is a simple adventure implemented using the AdveBuilder engine.  The game is set in 15 (or maybe 16) rooms.

Being a soldier of fortune _sounds_ romantic; but the ugly truth is, people are simply not prepared to pay for your services.  When they even bother to offer you a share of the treasure, they expect you to take outrageous risks and be grateful for the experience and the exposure.  In desperation, you have signed up with a strange employment agency in a building you did not know existed, on a street you have never walked down before; and now you have the following list of apparently simple tasks:
```
Feed Tiddles
Return library book
Mend leaking pipe
Water pot plant
```
Good, honest, old-fashioned odd jobs for the odd bob.  Surely nothing can go wrong?  Nothing on that list sounds dangerous; and in any case, the old cat lady, the nice young family, the shopkeeper and the softly-spoken gentleman with the long, grey hair will be there to show you where to find everything .....

Bobajob Street was written to test polystate objects and also introduce the ideas of "container" objects and non-player characters.  It ended up taking a darker turn  ;)
